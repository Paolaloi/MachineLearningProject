# PROJECT 1: Kernelized Linear Classification

## STUDENT: Paola Loi

The goal of this project is to implement kernelized linear classification algorithms using the Python language, without relying on pre-built packages. 
The aim is to classify labels based on numerical features using the l loss function. This is accomplished by implementing various algorithms, including the Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the Pegasos algorithm, and regularized logistic classification. 
The hyperparameters and data characteristics are compared and evaluated to prevent overfitting and underfitting, thereby identifying the most effective classification model.
Following a thorough analysis and cleaning of the dataset, the algorithms are defined structurally, and the dataset is divided into training and test sets. 
To enhance code clarity and flexibility, the initialization of the algorithms is deferred to a later stage within the code flow, where different hyperparameters are tested and evaluated using cross-validation. Finally, the model is tested using the optimal hyperparameters identified. The critical aspect of this project is the evaluation of algorithm performance, conducted through in-depth analysis.
